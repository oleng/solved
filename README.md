# [solved] problems from leetcode

This is a repository for leetcode problems I've taken and solved, and hopefully as time goes on,
will be filled with notes on the best solution in each problem (most likely not by me) as well as
the challenges and lessons I've learned from each particular problem and solutions.

As of Sept 2020, the solutions are all in Python 3.
