# solved

This is a repository for solutions I've taken and solved on online coding challenge platforms,
and hopefully as time goes on, will be filled with notes on the best solution in each problem
(most likely not by me) as well as the challenges and lessons I've learned from each particular
problem and solutions.

As of Sept 2020, solutions are all in Python 3.
