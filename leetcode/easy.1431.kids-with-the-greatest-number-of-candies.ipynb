    "### 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies (Easy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the array candies and the integer `extraCandies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies that the `i`-th kid has.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each kid check if there is a way to distribute `extraCandies` among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**Example 1**:    \n",
    "Input: candies = `[2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3`     \n",
    "Output: `[true,true,true,false,true]`    \n",
    "Explanation:      \n",
    "```Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. \n",
    "Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. \n",
    "Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. \n",
    "Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. \n",
    "Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids.\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2**:     \n",
    "Input: candies = `[4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1`     \n",
    "Output: `[true,false,false,false,false]`    \n",
    "Explanation:      \n",
    "`There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies among the kids regardless of who takes the extra candy.`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3**:      \n",
    "Input: `candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10`    \n",
